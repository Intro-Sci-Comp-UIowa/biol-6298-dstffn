# Data Aquisition

Data for this COSMOS 2019 project was gathered from, Tabet ey al., 2016 (Gene Expression Omnibus Sereies GSE51649).
This data was generated in order to establish the role of FMRP portein in translocation of neuronal mRNAs synaptic structures. In this study mRNAs were collected from FMRP using cross-linking immunoprecipitation and microarray (CLIP-microarray). RNA was collected from 10 seperate primary cortical cultures (5 from control cultures, and another 5 from FRM1-KO cultures, each f which were used to create an CLIP and INPUT sample for microarray analysis).

### This folder contains the CEL files that assocaited with the microarray data from tabet et al. 2015

File naming scheme: 
ID number followed by wether the sample if from the Input sample (baseline) or from the expreimental (CLIP). These samples are further organized by the sameple type and number, where (Wt) indicates samples collected from the control group and KO indicates samples collecterd from the mutant line.
