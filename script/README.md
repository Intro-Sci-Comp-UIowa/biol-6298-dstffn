# Script files 
This file contains the start of a importved code for the volcano plot that I will be reproducing for the COSMOS project. 

The Goal of this figure is to show signficant changes in gene expression from the paper. The volcano plot will also give indications of what genes are significant, and based on thier fold change 
These will be designated by colors, while genes of interest will be specfucally labeled to be more easy for the reader

# volcano plot script 
The volcano plot script will be used to create the actual figure. It will use the output file from the CEL analysing scirpt to create the final graph using the ggplot2 package 

# CEL 
First try at creating a script to get an output CSV file for the volcano plot script (having issues with needing different versions of R)

# CEL updated 
Current code for the creating of the CSV files to pipe into the volcano plot script 


Sorry these scritps are not in Rmarkdown, as I keep getting errors when trying to convert to R markdown, I did my best to make sure they where easy to read and the comments were detailed
