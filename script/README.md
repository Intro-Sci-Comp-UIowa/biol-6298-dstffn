This file contains the start of a importved code for the volcano plot that I will be reproducing for the COSMOS project. 

The Goal of this figure is to show signficant changes in gene expression from the paper. The volcano plot will also give indications of what genes are significant, and based on thier fold change 
These will be designated by colors, while genes of interest will be specfucally labeled to be more easy for the reader
